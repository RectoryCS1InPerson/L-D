 My Hobby is playing lacrosse and in lacrosse some of the key skills for you to have are cradling and running. You also need passing and stick skills to play. A peice of equipment you need at all time is a mouthguard, googles, and a stick.

I love lacrosse because allows me to be free and not worry about everything that's been going on in the world at that time,also it makes me happy I love to learn new tricks and just have fun.When i'm angry or stressed playing lacrosse claims me down mentally and physically,this is some reasons why I love to play lacrosse.

You can find Lacrosse books in almost any store. These books can teach you how to play. They also give you stick stratgies and facts about the game. They also tell you the rules of the overall game.
